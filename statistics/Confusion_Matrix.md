# Hypothesis

Alternate Hypothesis -> The alternate that you are tryng to prove

# Confusion Matrix:

1st Term -> Prediction False or True  ( T = Predictions are correct / F = Predictions are incorrect)
2nd Term -> Actually Yes (Positive) or No (Negative)
    
TP -> Prediction is Correct, Actually Positive (Yes) [Increase]
  
FP -> (Type 1 Error) Prediction is Incorrect, actually Positive (Yes) [Decrease]

TN -> Prediction is Correct, Actually Negative (No) [Increase]

FN -> (Type 2 Error) Prediction is Incorrect, actually Negative (No) [Decrease]
